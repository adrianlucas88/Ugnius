        About Me!
        <p class="about-text">
          It took me time to reach this level in my music, and I’m so glad I
          stuck with it. I’ve felt the beginnings of my music from just a kid-
          the vibrations resonating within me and an urge to recreate. So around
          the age of 5, I just sit in front of a piano and start tapping away,
          waiting for a harmony to my melody, waiting for something to strike a
          note within me. Around those times I was listening to a Ukrainian
          Singer, Ruslana. She was a modern take on folk music of Ukraine and
          her take was so individual and unique, so powerful that I couldn’t get
          enough. She was the first one to strike the match, and so I kept on
          tapping. It was the new millennium before I caught up with the greats-
          Sinatra, Ray Charles, Whitney Houston. Those unforgettable vocalists,
          screaming to the world in all their complexity, but still expression
          simple and pure. These artists spoke to me, it felt like every lyric
          was twisted through my conscious, intertwined with the pulsing blood
          in my veins. I moved the way they moved and kept the rhythm in time
          until I felt myself glide onto a completely new path- one that felt
          more like my own. Fast forward 10 years and I’ve taken these
          influences and pushed them to new extremes. They’ve always been there
          and probably always will, but now I’m writing my own music, singing my
          own songs, expressing the way I felt like these artists did and more.
          I’m writing my own story and hoping to inspire anyone in any margin
          that I can. Music belongs to everyone and by singing I’m giving my
          audience a piece of me. Now, I try to remain creative and free,
          without restricting myself to genres or titles. When I sing, my
          worries are released and the simple stresses of an average life flood
          out of me, like a dam’s been broken or something. I’ve grown a lot,
          and learned a lot about music, listened and thought about a lot of
          things- about creating something that’s minimal and tasteful, keeping
          it classy. I’ve so many ideas that I’m looking to explore and more
          inspirations that I continue to aspire towards, but I do now what I’ve
          always wanted to do, and I’ll still be doing it tomorrow.
